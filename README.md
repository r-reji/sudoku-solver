# sudokuSolver

This repository contains the code for a basic back-tracking algorithm that is used to solve a 9x9 sudoku. The motivation for this was one of the BreakTheCode.tech 2.0 challenges.

To change the sudoku that is being solved you will have to manually edit the .cpp file and build it - it will print out a solution to your console.
